# Bamazon

This application will supply you with a list of items.  You will be given eight items, each of which will have their own:
* Unique ID
* Product name
* Short description
* Price per unit.

## How to work the app

After being shown the list of items, you will then choose which item you would like to purchase, by typing in the item's associated ID, and then the number of the quantity of the item you would like.

* If the quantity you entered exceeds the amount that is within the database, you will be given a message informing you so and ending the connection.

* If there are enough of the items you requested within the database, you will be shown the total cost of your purchase.
